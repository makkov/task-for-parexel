# task-for-parexel

As a part of the interview for Statistical Programmer position we would like to suggest you the following problem as a home task: please create a table with descriptive statistics for “Iris Flowers” dataset.

Data: iris.data
Data description: info.names
Both can be found in the attachment.
Some general words about dataset can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

Requirements for the solution:
1. You can use any programming language of your choice for this task.
2. Created table should be consistent with the template below (reasonable deviations from layout are acceptable). Numbers in the table should be replaced with actual numbers based on the data.
3. Alignment of numbers is left up to you but the table should be readable and easy to understand.
4. Precision should be:
- N – integer
- Min, max – same precision as in the data (1 decimal point)
5. Median, mean, standard deviation - +1 digit to the data precision
6. Percentages should be rounded up to 1 digit after decimal point

It is expected that you’ll send back:
- program named “solution” (with extension depending on prog language)
- table named “iris-flowers.txt” containing analysis described above.
